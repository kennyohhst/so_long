make an mlx instance				= mlx_t		*struct_name = mlx_init(int_size_of_window, int_size_of_window, name_of_window, resizeable_bool)
png into texture_struct				= mlx_texture_t *struct_name = mlx_load_png("name_of.png");
texture_struct into image_struct	= mlx_image_t	*struct_name = mlx_texture_to_image(mlx_struct, texture_struct,);
put image to initilized window		= mlx_image_to_window(mlx_struct, image_struct, position_image, position_image);
put window onto screen				= mlx_loop(mlx_struct)
mlx_loop_hook does not search for mlx_loop, so mlx_loop is the last in line

what needs to happen?
build_game needs to do the following:
-	build the MLX instance
-	insert images
-	put it all in place

run game needs to do the following:
-	mlx_loop_hook
-	mlx_loop
